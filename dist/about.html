                <p>
                    I am a 3rd year CS undergraduate at Michigan Tech! My passion lies in programming and web 
                    development, I like to work with SQL databases but above all I enjoy learning new
                    skills and picking up/working on projects.

                <p>
                    At the 2019 Michigan Tech Winter Wonderhack I competed as leader of a two man team and placed
                    3rd overall and won 'Most Practical' award. The project I headed was software which was written
                    in Python and used machine learning to identify license plates and parse them in order to read
                    letters and numbers from a jpg file. More info on this can be found on my 'My Work' page.

                <p>
                    NCSA is a student organization, which I am a part of, at Michigan Tech which strives to further develop
                    networking, computing, and cybersecurity skills outside the classroom through independent research and
                    weekly seminars. We have recently taken on a project to revitalize Michigan Tech's now discontinued
                    Barkboard. We are rebuiliding the site from the ground up and I have taken lead of developing the database
                    system which will back the site.

                <p>
                    The final project for this class was to design and implement an SQL backed online exam system.
                    My responsibilities for the project included constructing an E-R diagram representing the conceptual
                    design of the database as well as creating a refined relational schema from said E-R diagram. I was
                    also in charge of implementing the system and wrote the code for it in PHP and used HTML and CSS for
                    the web end.
